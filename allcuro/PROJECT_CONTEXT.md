## 4. Key Rules for Development

1. **Zero Overflow:** Always ensure horizontal filter lists have adequate container height (`height: 40px` with horizontal-only padding) and avoid hardcoded fixed height on multi-line text cards.
2. **Light-Touch KYC:** Customers do not require full medical KYC up-front; basic mobile OTP + address unlocks short stays and visits, while higher-value equipment rentals prompt for Aadhaar verification at checkout.
3. **Emergency Care Priority:** Keep the 2-hour priority urgent banner prominent on the home screen.
